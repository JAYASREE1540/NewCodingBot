# Define the number of natural numbers
n = 200

# Calculate the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers
sum_of_squares = sum(i**2 for i in range(1, n+1))

# Calculate the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers
sum_of_numbers = sum(i for i in range(1, n+1))
square_of_sum = sum_of_numbers**2

# Calculate the difference
difference = square_of_sum - sum_of_squares

# Print the result
print(f"The difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first {n} natural numbers is: {difference}")
